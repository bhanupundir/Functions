        "\n",
        "### 1. **Parameters**:\n",
        "- **Parameters** are the variables listed in the function definition.\n",
        "- They are placeholders that define what kind of values the function expects to receive when it's called.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### Example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name, age):\n",
        "    print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",
        "```\n",

        "   def greet(name, age):\n",
        "       print(f\"Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.\")\n",

        "4. **Variable-length Arguments**: These allow you to pass a variable number of arguments to a function using `*args` for non-keyword arguments and `**kwargs` for keyword arguments.\n",
        "   - **`*args`** collects extra positional arguments.\n",
        "   - **`**kwargs`** collects extra keyword arguments.\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Exits the Function**: When the `return` statement is executed, it immediately terminates the function's execution. Any code after the `return` statement within the function is not executed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Returns a Value**: The primary purpose of `return` is to send a value from the function back to the caller. This allows the result of the function to be used elsewhere in the program.\n",

        "For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def add(a, b):\n",

        "result = add(3, 5)\n",
        "print(result)  # Output: 8\n",
        "```\n",
        "In this case, `return a + b` sends the sum of `a` and `b` back to the caller, where it's stored in the `result` variable and printed.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Optional**: If the `return` statement is omitted, the function will return `None` by default. This happens when there is no explicit `return` or if the function doesn't return any value.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "def greet(name):\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, both **iterables** and **iterators** are essential concepts for working with sequences of data, but they have distinct roles.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Iterables**:\n",
        "An **iterable** is any object in Python that can return an iterator. In other words, an iterable is an object that can be looped over (iterated) using a `for` loop or any other iterative construct. Examples of iterables include lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, and sets.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points about Iterables:**\n",
        "- An iterable is any object that implements the `__iter__()` method or defines a `__getitem__()` method (the object can be indexed, and its items can be retrieved in a sequence).\n",
        "- You can pass an iterable to the `iter()` function to get an iterator.\n",
        "- Examples of iterables: lists (`[1, 2, 3]`), strings (`\"hello\"`), sets (`{1, 2, 3}`).\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Iterators**:\n",
        "An **iterator** is an object that represents a stream of data, which is returned by calling the `iter()` function on an iterable. Iterators are objects that allow you to iterate (or loop) over the elements of an iterable one at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Key Points about Iterators:**\n",
        "- An iterator must implement two methods:\n",
        "  1. `__iter__()`: Returns the iterator object itself. This is required so that the iterator can be used in a loop.\n",
        "  2. `__next__()`: Returns the next item from the stream. If there are no more items, it raises a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
        "- Once an iterator is exhausted (i.e., no more elements are available), any subsequent calls to `__next__()` will raise a `StopIteration` exception.\n",
        "- Example of an iterator: if you use the `iter()` function on a list, the result is an iterator.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **Key Differences**:\n",
        "1. **Definition**:\n",
        "   - **Iterable**: An object that can return an iterator when passed to `iter()`.\n",
        "   - **Iterator**: An object that keeps track of its current position and can return the next item on each `__next__()` call.\n",
        "   \n",
        "2. **Purpose**:\n",
        "   - **Iterable**: Allows you to define a sequence of items, such as a list or string.\n",
        "   - **Iterator**: Used to actually traverse through that sequence one item at a time.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Methods**:\n",
        "   - **Iterable**: Implements the `__iter__()` method.\n",
        "   - **Iterator**: Implements both `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Example:\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of an iterable\n",
        "my_list = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "iterator = iter(my_list)  # Convert iterable to iterator\n",
        "\n",
        "# Example of using an iterator\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 1\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 2\n",
        "print(next(iterator))  # Output: 3\n",
        "# Next call will raise StopIteration\n",
        "# print(next(iterator))  # Uncommenting this line will raise StopIteration\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "- An **iterable** is any object that can return an iterator, allowing it to be iterated over.\n",
        "- An **iterator** is the object that actually performs the iteration and keeps track of the current position.\n",

        "\n",
        "In Python, **generators** are a type of iterable, like lists or tuples, but unlike them, they allow you to iterate over their items one at a time without storing the entire sequence in memory. This makes generators very efficient, especially for large datasets or when you only need to access items one by one, as they generate values lazily (i.e., they produce items only when required).\n",
        "\n",
        "### Key Points about Generators:\n",
        "\n",

        "**7. What are the advantages of using generators over regular functions?**\n",
        "\n",
        " Ans--> Generators offer several key advantages over regular functions in programming, particularly in Python. Here are the main benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Memory Efficiency**:\n",
        "   - **Lazy Evaluation**: Generators compute values on the fly as you iterate over them, rather than generating and storing the entire list in memory. This is particularly useful when working with large data sets or infinite sequences, where storing everything in memory would be inefficient or impossible.\n",
        "   - **No Need to Store Data**: Instead of returning a collection (like a list), a generator yields one item at a time, which means you only need enough memory to hold the current item in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Improved Performance**:\n",
        "   - **On-demand Execution**: Because a generator only calculates the next value when asked for it, there can be performance benefits, especially when the entire sequence is not needed at once.\n",
        "   - **Reduced Overhead**: Unlike functions that return large collections, a generator uses less memory and reduces the computational overhead of generating and storing all values upfront.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **State Retention**:\n",
        "   - **Automatic State Management**: Generators remember their state between calls. This means that after yielding a value, the generator function \"pauses\" and can pick up where it left off on the next iteration, without the need for additional code to manage the state manually.\n",
        "   - **Efficient State Management**: In contrast, regular functions often require manual state management (such as using global variables or class instances), which can be more error-prone and less elegant.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Cleaner Code**:\n",
        "   - **Simplicity**: Using generators simplifies code when you need to create iterators. For example, a generator can replace complex classes or functions designed to create iterators, leading to more concise and readable code.\n",
        "   - **Avoiding Temporary Lists**: You can generate values without needing to construct and manage a temporary list or collection, which is useful for processes that are more concerned with iteration than collection.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Infinite Sequences**:\n",
        "   - **Handling Infinite Data**: Generators can represent infinite sequences (like counting numbers or streaming data) that cannot be represented using regular functions that return all values at once. Since generators yield values one by one, they allow you to work with theoretically infinite sequences without running into memory or performance issues.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Improved Control Flow**:\n",
        "   - **Control with `yield`**: The `yield` statement in generators offers more flexibility in controlling the flow of the function. You can pause the execution of a function, return a value, and then resume execution later, which is not easily done with regular functions that return results all at once.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, generators provide memory efficiency, improved performance for large or infinite sequences, cleaner code, and better state management compared to regular functions, making them ideal for scenarios that involve large datasets, complex iteration, or real-time processing."

        "\n",
        "**Ans-->** A **lambda function** in Python is a small, anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It allows you to write a function in a concise way without having to use a formal `def` block. Lambda functions are commonly used when you need a simple, one-line function that is not reused elsewhere in your code.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Syntax:\n",
        "```python\n",
        "lambda arguments: expression\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "- **`arguments`**: A comma-separated list of parameters (can be zero or more).\n",
        "- **`expression`**: An expression that is evaluated and returned as the result of the function.\n",

        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",
        "print(add(3, 5))  # Output: 8\n",

        "\n",
        "1. **Short, Throwaway Functions**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are ideal for short, simple tasks where defining a full function using `def` is unnecessary. They are often used in situations where a function is needed temporarily or as an argument to another function.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Higher-Order Functions**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are commonly used in higher-order functions like `map()`, `filter()`, and `sorted()`, which require a function as an argument.\n",

        "     print(even_numbers)  # Output: [2, 4]\n",
        "     ```\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Sorting**:\n",
        "   Lambda functions are often used as the `key` argument in sorting operations where the sort criteria are more complex than the default sorting order.\n",
        "\n",
        "   - **Example with `sorted()`**:\n",
        "     ```python\n",
        "     pairs = [(1, 'one'), (3, 'three'), (2, 'two')]\n",
        "     sorted_pairs = sorted(pairs, key=lambda x: x[0])  # Sort by first element\n",
        "     print(sorted_pairs)  # Output: [(1, 'one'), (2, 'two'), (3, 'three')]\n",
        "     ```\n",

        "### Characteristics:\n",
        "- **Anonymous**: Lambda functions do not have a name unless you assign them to a variable.\n",
        "- **Single Expression**: The body of a lambda function can only be a single expression (no statements, like loops or conditionals).\n",
        "- **Return Value**: The result of the expression is automatically returned without the need for a `return` statement.\n",
        "\n",

        "**Ans-->** The `map()` function in Python is a built-in function used to apply a specified function to each item in an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.) and return an iterator that yields the results.
